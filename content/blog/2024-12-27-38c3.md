We are on the congress this year. You can find us in [the Onion Cluster in Hall H](https://38c3.c3nav.de/l/hspsh/). 

<!--more-->

We have arrived over train, cars and plane. 9 active members came with at least 5 close friends of the space. At least 5 people are here for the first time. 

## Badges

Two of our members are offering electronic badges under moniker of [Rough Rat](https://github.com/rough-rat). You can acquire them at our assembly. Or at [Hardware Hacking Area](https://38c3.c3nav.de/l/hha/), if they moved there already after Rust debugging session. 

## Art

Our friend [Anna Maria](sanma.cargo.site) has an art installation about hacker values and their valued laptop stickers. You can [find it near the entrance](https://38c3.c3nav.de/l/c:0:189.94:179.69/). Check it out, you may see your own laptop if you already had a conversation with Anna.

Further more, Łasica has her own two art installations somewhere on the congress. But you may need to look for them on your own.
